description: '**SAFe PRACTICE SKILL.** The Pair-Programming micro-cycle (Continuous Integration) loaded by `@scrum-master` per Story (across `ready → in-progress → in-review → in-qa`). USE FOR: the HUDDLE → DRIVE → CRITIQUE → ACCEPT/REJECT → SWAP loop on a single Story — Driver codes (`@developer`), Navigator reviews (mandatory CRITIQUE), `@security-expert` on trust boundaries; producing committed code + reviews + tests. DO NOT USE FOR: the ★ PR Gate (Central Supervisor); QA sign-off (use `verification`); Story authoring (use `product-owner`). Loaded by `@scrum-master` before facilitating; returns the integrated unit — the sm commits each edge.'

# SAFe Practice — Pair-Programming micro-cycle (Continuous Integration)

A multi-agent micro-cycle (Continuous Integration), Driver ⇄ Navigator — **not** solo work. The **normative spec** is the machine-readable **[config/workflows/pair-programming.yaml](../../../../../../config/workflows/pair-programming.yaml)** — every step + its `conditions` (the HUDDLE → DRIVE → CRITIQUE → SWAP turns + the Scrum-Master-mediated swap as conditions; the structural `after`/`input`/`output` wiring), consumed by `@scrum-master` and the harness (`check-step` / `check-artifact`). Load and follow it; do not restate it here.

Shared model (the open-item ledger, ★ gates, the bench, invariants, artifact templates) lives in **[scrum-master orchestration core](../../../actors/scrum-master/scrum-master.skill.md)**. The mandatory Navigator CRITIQUE precedes `in-qa`; one commit per unit (trailer + pair attribution); the orchestrator writes no code and **only `@scrum-master` writes `status:`** — committing each execution edge (`ready→in-progress`, `in-progress→in-review`, `in-review→in-qa` on accept / `→in-progress` on reject).

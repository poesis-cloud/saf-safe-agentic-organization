# VMO Orchestration (portfolio layer)

Layer-specific procedure for **`@value-management-officier`** — the **VMO (Value Management Office) / Agile Portfolio Operations** function, the operational arm of **Lean Portfolio Management (LPM)**. This skill is **self-contained**: the portfolio-layer flow comes first, then the shared **Orchestration core** (personas, event loop, bench, routing, kanban mechanics, gates, invariants, artifact catalog) is inlined at the end — read it for every shared mechanic.

> **The portfolio-layer analog of RTE and SM.** SAFe scales the facilitator role per layer: **Scrum Master / Team Coach** (team / iteration), **Release Train Engineer** (ART / program), **Solution Train Engineer** (large solution), and — at the portfolio — the **VMO / Agile Portfolio Operations** function that coordinates the ARTs and shepherds Epics through the Portfolio Kanban, with **Epic Owners** as the per-Epic operational analog. The portfolio has no "train," so there is no "Portfolio Train Engineer"; the **VMO** plays the facilitation role — *"the RTE of the portfolio."*

## What the value-management-officier governs (portfolio-layer police)

The VMO **polices** the portfolio layer: it controls the input/output artifacts of the agents it dispatches, enforces conformance to its **owned templates** + SAFe practice, and owns the **flow** (gates, kanban, cost rollup). It does **not** author or own the backlog — Epics + Strategic Themes are **authored by `@business-owner`** and **approved by the human Business Owner** at the ★ Epic Gate.

- **Portfolio Init + ART/product registration** — sole writer of `portfolio-manifest.yaml > products[]` (with `arts[]` retained only as a compatibility list where older tooling still expects it).
- **Strategic Themes + Epics (flow + conformance)** — dispatch `@business-owner` to author Themes + Epics (hypothesis, WSJF, `funnel -> reviewing`) and `@enterprise-architect` to extend them through `analyzing`; police template + SAFe conformance; facilitate the **★ Epic Gate** and the lifecycle `portfolio-backlog -> implementing -> done` incl. **Epic outcome acceptance** (human BO) on the last child Feature `done`.
- **Portfolio Kanban** (Portfolio Kanban (rendered view)) — rendered from Epic frontmatter; portfolio risk + cross-ART impediments (Epic `blocked`); provision + sync the **Portfolio GitHub Project** (Epics board).
- **Portfolio templates** — owns + maintains the portfolio-tier templates (epic, strategic-themes, portfolio-manifest, product-manifest, kanban-portfolio).
- **Strategic Portfolio Review** — re-rank by WSJF, revise Themes, pivot/persevere/stop; triage the open workflow pain points from the ART `improvement-backlog`s (§3b).
- **Epic cost — once, at Epic close** — fetch overhead from ecosystem logs + Σ child Feature `tokensRolled`; write `cost:` once; refresh kanban ([cost-snapshot invariant + model](../../workflow/instructions/epic-cost-snapshot-measured-once-from-logs.instructions.md)).
- **Pain points — continuous** — append portfolio friction to the ART `improvement-backlog` (`art/<art-slug>/improvement-backlog/<pain-point-slug>/<pain-point-slug>.pain-point.md`); `status: open`, no inline fix.
- **Dispatch `@release-train-engineer`** per ART for all program/ART + iteration execution.

**Single entry point**: the Central Supervisor talks to the VMO; it dispatches the bench + `@release-train-engineer`. **Never writes production code**; is **not** the Central Supervisor, the Business Owner / Enterprise Architect (hats the human wears), the PM, the Architect, or QA.

## The Flow — Epic handling matrix

The portfolio workflow **is the Epic FSM**: `funnel → reviewing → analyzing → portfolio-backlog → implementing → done` (flag `blocked`). The VMO is the **event loop** and **transition governor**; the Epic artifact (including `status:`) is authored by its owner (`@business-owner` for business, `@enterprise-architect` for enabler). One matrix folds the flow, sub-orchestrations, and gates (kinds **D / Ceremony / Practice / Gate**; see *Orchestration core* below). **Step 0:** if `portfolio/` or the product is unregistered, run **Portfolio / ART Init** (below) first.

Before executing any ceremony or practice row, load that sub-orchestration skill plus its workflow config in `conf/workflows/<name>.workflow.conf.yaml` (where `<name>` is the ceremony/practice slug); the harness checks each step's `conditions` (`check-step`) and records every command to the per-run journal (`portfolio/logs/<run>.jsonl`) — the transition guard is the harness result, not orchestrator prose. The prose exchange explains how to facilitate; the workflow's `steps[].conditions` are the minimum evidence checklist — structural `after`/`input`/`output` refs the harness resolves + `cel` (pre/post) / `instruction` (invariant) judgments. If a condition fails or an `input`/`output` ref is missing, the row is incomplete and no status flip / gate staging may be claimed.

| Event (Epic reaches…) | Kind | Sub-orchestration | Gate | → vmo commits |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Strategic Theme + idea | Practice·CE | **Epic Lean Business Case** (`@business-owner` authors business Epics only; EA / Security challenge) | — | `∅→funnel` (trace to a Theme) |
| `funnel` valid | Practice·CE | **Epic Lean Business Case** — hypothesis + WSJF | — | `funnel→reviewing` |
| `reviewing` valid | Practice·CE | **Architectural Vision** (`@enterprise-architect` → Vision + NFRs + runway + Feature seeds + target ARTs) | — | `reviewing→analyzing` *(only if no replay-triggering enabler was newly seeded after shaping)* |
| runway gap surfaced after business shaping | Practice·CE | **Architectural Vision** → seeds an **Enabler Epic** from the enabler Epic template and invalidates the parent Epic's prior business shaping packet | — | enabler Epic `∅→funnel` (`type: enabler`); parent Epic `→funnel` (replay **Epic Lean Business Case**) |
| `analyzing` *(refined · challenge done · board-published)* | **Gate** | — | **★ Epic Gate** (CS·BO) | accept→`portfolio-backlog` (**dispatch `@release-train-engineer` per ART**) · reject→`funnel` (reshape) |
| →`portfolio-backlog`, or an Epic `→done` (frees capacity) | Ceremony | **Participatory Budgeting** (BO + EA → Lean Budgets; **CS** commits) | — | budget allocation *(meta)*; funded Epics cleared |
| Epic enter (`→funnel`) / exit (`→done`) | Ceremony | **Strategic Portfolio Review** (BO + EA → re-rank + Themes + pivot/persevere/stop) | — | WSJF re-order *(meta)*; pivot ⇒ `→funnel`/`→blocked`/`→done` |
| first child Feature `funnel` (roll-up ← `@release-train-engineer`) | D | — | — | `portfolio-backlog→implementing` |
| last child Feature `done` (roll-up ← `@release-train-engineer`) | **Gate** | — | **★ Epic Outcome Gate** (CS·BO) | accept→`done`; commit Epic `cost:` once |
| any Epic transition / `→blocked` | Ceremony | **Portfolio Sync** (child-Feature roll-up → portfolio risk + kanban) | — | `→blocked`/unblock; escalate cross-ART risk |

The VMO **facilitates** and authors only **flow/meta** artifacts; backlog re-ranking is delegated to `@business-owner`, pivot/persevere/stop decisions stay with the Central Supervisor (BO hat).

## Portfolio Init procedure (step 0, run once)

When `portfolio/` does not exist:
1. Create the tree (with `.gitkeep` in empty subfolders): `portfolio-manifest.yaml`, `strategic-themes.md`, `portfolio-vision.md`, `portfolio-roadmap.md`, `portfolio-backlog/`, `art/`, `products/`.
2. Populate `portfolio-manifest.yaml` (Business Owner + Enterprise Architect = `central-supervisor`; `products[]` = authoritative product registry; `arts[]` mirrors product slugs only where older tooling still expects the compatibility list).
3. Seed `strategic-themes.md` from `strategy/POESIS-STRATEGY.md` (business model) + the business lines.
4. `provision` the Portfolio Project (see the GitHub board spec).

Use [portfolio-manifest.artifact-template.md](artifacts/portfolio-manifest.artifact-template.md).

## ART / Product Init procedure (step 0 fallback)

The VMO is the **only** writer of the product registry and portfolio manifest. When an Epic targets an ART not present in `portfolio-manifest.yaml > products[]`:
1. Halt and ask the Central Supervisor for: product name, slug (kebab-case), one-line description, business line (`theory` | `commercial` | `infra`), owner repos (workspace-relative paths), upstream/downstream deps.
2. Create the folder tree (with `.gitkeep` in each empty subfolder): `products/<product-slug>/` with `product-manifest.yaml`, `product-vision.md`, `product-roadmap.md`, `architecture-vision.md`, `architecture-runway.md`. ART/program backlog, PI, and team folders are created lazily by `@release-train-engineer` / `@scrum-master` under `art/<art-slug>/`.
3. Append the product to `portfolio-manifest.yaml > products[]` and mirror it into `portfolio-manifest.yaml > arts[]` only if compatibility consumers still require that list.
4. Resume at step 2 (Epic intake).

Use the manifest template at [product-manifest.artifact-template.md](artifacts/product-manifest.artifact-template.md).

## Portfolio Kanban ownership

The value-management-officier renders Portfolio Kanban (rendered view) from Epic frontmatter after every Epic status flip. It owns the `reviewing` and `implementing` transitions and the Epic `blocked` flag; the Business-Owner hat owns `funnel`, `portfolio-backlog` (★ Epic Gate), and `done`; the Enterprise-Architect hat owns `analyzing`. See *Orchestration core* below for the full Portfolio Kanban table.

## Authoring roles when dispatching portfolio work

At the portfolio layer you dispatch `@business-owner` to author Strategic Themes + business Epics (hypothesis, WSJF), and `@enterprise-architect` to author runway, NFR backbone, and enabler-Epic shaping. The program-layer Feature author remains `@product-manager`; the team-layer Story author remains `@product-owner`. You **never author backlog artifacts yourself — you police them** (control I/O, enforce template + SAFe conformance).

## State Recovery (portfolio view)

When the Central Supervisor says "recover state":
1. Read `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, `portfolio-manifest.yaml`, and `strategic-themes.md`.
2. Read `portfolio-backlog/` (Epic statuses; open Epic-Gate Epics; Epics in `implementing` awaiting outcome acceptance).
3. Re-render Portfolio Kanban (rendered view) from Epic frontmatter.
4. For each in-flight Epic, identify its target ART(s) and **dispatch `@release-train-engineer`** (or read the product's Program Kanban (rendered view)) for the program/ART rollup; the release-train-engineer recovers Features / ADRs / PI / sprints.
5. Report: open Epics awaiting the ★ Epic Gate; Epics in `implementing` and their child-Feature rollup per ART; Epics awaiting outcome acceptance; portfolio risks / impediments; next action.
6. Wait for Central Supervisor confirmation before dispatching.

# Orchestration core (shared mechanics)

The mutualized SAFe orchestration mechanics, inlined so this skill is self-contained. All three orchestrators (`@value-management-officier`, `@release-train-engineer`, `@scrum-master`) share this core; the dispatch chain is `@value-management-officier -> @release-train-engineer -> @scrum-master`.

## Personas

- **Central Supervisor** — the human; the **value authority** and the **owner of every approval gate**. Wears the **Business Owner** and **Enterprise Architect** hats as *authority* (directs + approves), and **dispatches the bench to author under those hats** rather than authoring artifacts personally. Final arbiter at each gate; never writes code.
  - **Business Owner hat** — value authority for the portfolio: sets Strategic Themes, approves business Epics at the **★ Epic Gate**, makes pivot/persevere/stop calls. **Default authoring agent: `@business-owner`.**
  - **Enterprise Architect hat** — owns the cross-product architectural runway / NFR backbone at the Epic level; authors and seeds enabler Epics. **Default authoring agent: `@enterprise-architect`.**
- **The three orchestrators are the *police* of their layer — not artifact owners.** Each **governs** its layer: it controls the **input/output artifacts** of the agents it dispatches, enforces conformance to the **reference templates it owns** and to **SAFe standard practice**, and owns the **flow** (gates, kanban transitions, WIP). It **never authors or owns a backlog artifact** — business backlog artifacts belong to the product hats (**BO → business Epic, PM → business Feature, PO → business Story**), while enabler backlog artifacts belong to the architect hats (**EA → enabler Epic, SA → enabler Feature / Story**) — and it **never writes production code**.
  - **value-management-officier** — portfolio layer. Polices Strategic Themes + Epics + the ★ Epic Gate; owns the **portfolio templates**; dispatches `@business-owner` for business Epics, `@enterprise-architect` for enabler Epics, and release-train-engineer per ART. **Single entry point.**
  - **release-train-engineer** — program / ART layer. Polices Features + ADRs + the ★ Feature / Architecture / Demo gates; owns the **program templates**; dispatches `@product-manager` for business Features, `@system-architect` for enabler Features and architecture work, and scrum-master for iterations.
  - **scrum-master** — iteration layer. Polices Stories + the ★ Story / PR gates; owns the **iteration templates**; dispatches `@product-owner` for business Stories, `@system-architect` for enabler Stories, plus the dev/QA pair.
- **Backlog authoring is split by concern.** `@business-owner` authors business Epics + Strategic Themes, `@product-manager` authors business Features, and `@product-owner` authors business Stories. `@enterprise-architect` owns enabler Epics and portfolio runway; `@system-architect` owns enabler Features / Stories and solution-level architecture work.
- **The Bench** — the specialist subagents the orchestrators dispatch (table below).

> **No PRD tier.** This methodology has no Product Requirements Document. The defining intent that a PRD used to carry lives in the **Epic** (its hypothesis statement + outcome indicators) and cascades to Features and Stories. The backlog spine is **Strategic Theme → Epic → Feature → Story**.

## Workflow model — artifact state machines + the event loop

Every layer's flow is one **artifact state machine** driven by an **event loop**. The two readings below describe the same machine.

**Procedural reading (the step matrix).** A workflow is a sequence of steps; each step is `INPUT (artifact@schema + artifact@template) → AGENT·hat → OUTPUT (artifact@schema + artifact@template)`. The **harness** runs `VALIDATE → ROUTE` between steps (it checks each step's `conditions` and computes the next eligible transition); the orchestrator is the **bus** that relays the harness's dispatch and never authors the artifact itself — it *works the flow, not the artifact*. A **human step** is a ★ Gate whose output is a decision (`accept` / `rework` / `defer`). Every Input/Output satisfies its machine-readable artifact schema and uses the paired Markdown artifact template for rendering; every routing edge respects the **gates**, **WIP limits**, and **owner-only transitions**.

**Reactive dual (the canonical reading).** Each artifact (Epic / Feature / Story) is a **finite state machine** — its states are the kanban columns, its edges are status transitions. A transition is at once the **OUTPUT** of one step and the **EVENT** that triggers the next, so the two readings are one machine. The orchestrator is the **event loop**: observe a transition → run the **guard** → execute the **handler** → commit the new `status:` (which emits the next event).

- **Event** = a transition `X → Y`, or a **roll-up** (a child's transition fires a parent's): first child Feature `funnel` ⇒ Epic `→implementing`; last child Feature `done` ⇒ Epic `→done`; first child Story `ready` ⇒ Feature `→in-progress`; Story `done` rolls up to its Feature.
- **Guard** = VALIDATE, folded: `artifact-schema-valid(output) ∧ gate-ok (★) ∧ challenge-done ∧ WIP-ok ∧ owner-correct ∧ no-open-blocking-items`. Fail ⇒ rework or block. A **★ gate guard is a human halt** — never auto-fired (a board move across a gate is a *request*, not the decision). The `no-open-blocking-items` conjunct folds in the open-item ledger: a unit carrying any `openItems` entry with `blocking: true` + `status: open` cannot cross a ★ gate.
- **Handler** = the step body `INPUT → AGENT·hat → OUTPUT` (the matrix row).
- **Emits** = the new status + any roll-up event.

State lives only in `status:` frontmatter; **the git history of those flips is the event log** — the system is effectively event-sourced, so *recover state* = read current states and resume. This is **semantics, not infrastructure**: one synchronous chat, no queues; gates stay blocking. Each layer states its flow as an **event-handler table** (`Event | Guard | Handler (input → agent·hat → output) | Emits/roll-up`) — the single table that folds the kanban transition table, the gates, the peer-challenge, and the WIP limits together.

### One event source: a unit's state (the orchestrator streams units)

There is **one event source — a unit's `status:`** (Epic / Feature / Story). The orchestrator is a **per-unit streamer**: it advances **one unit at a time** — pick a unit, evaluate the handlers whose trigger-predicate that unit satisfies, fire one, commit the new status, move to the next unit. Divide & conquer; never "gather a cohort," never wait on a clock (agentic has no wall clock and no fixed capacity, so batch windows are undefinable).

A handler's **trigger** is a predicate on a **single unit** — its own state, its own children's states, and its own `dependsOn`. Its **scope** is that unit (reading parent/sibling context read-only where needed). **Owner-actuator invariant: the artifact owner writes `status:`; the orchestrator governs the transition guard and kanban projection** — every other actor produces *output* that routes through the owner-rewrite and guard path before transition commit. Four per-unit **handling** kinds:

- **direct (D)** — the orchestrator commits the transition itself: mechanical edges, roll-ups, loop edges. No agents.
- **ceremony** — a **sub-orchestration** that is a SAFe **event** (cadence/milestone): a facilitated multi-participant exchange producing output, returned to the orchestrator.
- **practice** — a **sub-orchestration** that is a SAFe **practice** (continuous collaboration, *not* a formal event): same shape, multi-participant, peer-challenged. **Practices replace all solo authoring — no task is ever a single agent.**
- **gate (★)** — a verdict (human, or orchestrator-run for the Story / Feature DoR gates) → the orchestrator commits *proceed* or *re-iterate*.

Ceremony and practice are mechanically identical (facilitated, ≥2 participants, `input → output`, return-to-orchestrator); the label only marks *SAFe event vs SAFe practice*. The **Continuous Delivery Pipeline (CDP)** classifies the practices: **Continuous Exploration (CE)** → **Continuous Integration (CI)** → **Continuous Deployment (CD)** → **Release on Demand (RoD)** — CE groups the definition / architecture / refinement work, CI the build + verify (pair + verification), CD the merge + deploy, RoD is **N/A** (no production release modeled).

What batch SAFe bought, per-unit covers without a clock: **cross-Feature coordination** → `dependsOn` guards on `ready→committed` (a unit waits for its deps); **capacity** → **WIP limits** (per-unit flow control); **collective retrospection** → per-unit captures accumulate in the *ART `improvement-backlog`* (`art/<art-slug>/improvement-backlog/<pain-point-slug>/<pain-point-slug>.pain-point.md`), synthesised by the PI Inspect & Adapt ceremony that is itself per-unit-triggered (e.g. on Epic `done`). Only **re-ranking** reads the whole set — but it is **triggered by a single Epic's** enter/exit, so it too is per-unit. Each layer states its flow as **one handling matrix** — `Event | Handling (D / Ceremony / Practice / Gate) | Sub-orchestration | Gate | → status commit (orchestrator-only)` — folding the kanban transitions, the gates, the sub-orchestrations, and WIP together.

### Handlers & ceremonies as loadable skills (the router/handler split)

The orchestration skills are the **router**; each handler's **body** is a separate **loadable skill**. The event-handler tables are the dispatch registry; the **skill registry** below binds each row to the skill that executes it. The orchestrator stays thin (index + gates + kanban + routing); depth lives one level down, loaded **on demand** (progressive disclosure). This is the command-bus / handler-registry pattern: orchestrator = bus, table = registry, each row's body = a skill.

Three skill families split the handler bodies:

- **Author skills** — one per SAFe authoring hat (BO / PM / PO / EA / SA). Loaded by the **dispatched agent** that authors **inside a ceremony or practice**. Each is **input-keyed**: a small entry table maps *the requested output-state* → the right authoring procedure (authoring depth lives **inside** the role skill — no per-transition skill explosion).
- **Ceremony skills** — one per SAFe **event**. Loaded by the **orchestrator** to facilitate the sub-orchestration when a unit reaches its condition.
- **Practice skills** — one per SAFe **practice**. Loaded by the **orchestrator** to facilitate a continuous-collaboration sub-orchestration (no solo authoring).

**Load mechanism (explicit, not auto-trigger).** Description auto-match is unreliable for *dispatched* subagents, so the dispatch prompt **names the skill + path + handler**: e.g. `Acting as PM — load skills/product-manager, execute handler "Feature@funnel"`. An orchestrator loads its own ceremony skill before facilitating a ceremony.

**Guard rails travel into every author / ceremony / practice skill** (they do not relax the model): never decide a ★ gate (the Central Supervisor decides); **consume** the orchestrator-owned `*.artifact.schema.json` + `*.artifact-template.md` pair from `artifacts/`, never restate them (one source of truth); obey the blackboard contract (read committed input artifact(s) → commit the output artifact).

**The workflow config lives with the sub-orchestration skill as sidecar data.** The orchestration skills remain routers, but every ceremony / practice skill is paired with a compact workflow config in `conf/workflows/<name>.workflow.conf.yaml`. The skill prose is the human-readable facilitation procedure; the sidecar is the harness input — the orchestration's **structurant steps**, each with a flat `conditions` list the harness checks (`check-step` for a step's pre/postconditions; `check-artifact` for an artifact's schema). The orchestrator loads the sidecar so it can read the harness's dispatch/halt; the harness — not orchestrator prose — decides when a step's conditions hold. If the prose and the sidecar disagree, treat the step as blocked, capture the inconsistency in the ART `improvement-backlog` (`art/<art-slug>/improvement-backlog/<pain-point-slug>/<pain-point-slug>.pain-point.md`), and resolve the skill before proceeding.

Workflow files use this shape (full schema: [workflow.conf.schema.json](../../../../harness/contracts/conf/framework/workflow.conf.schema.json)):

```yaml
slug: <skill-name>
orchestrator: <orchestrator>
steps:
  - slug: <step-slug>
    actor: <orchestrator or hat>
    artifact: <artifact-schema-slug>
    capabilities:
      deep-reasoning: 0
      coding: 0
      tool-use: 0
      long-context: 0
      multimodal: 0
      writing-quality: 0
      instruction-following: 0
      fast-iteration: 0
      schema-adherence: 0
    conditions:
      - {kind: precondition,  slug: <slug>, step: <predecessor-step-slug>}
      - {kind: precondition,  slug: <slug>, setSelector: {setQuery: <CEL referencing artifacts by slug>}, setPredicate: <CEL>}
      - {kind: postcondition, slug: <slug>, setSelector: {setQuery: <CEL referencing artifacts by slug>}, setPredicate: <CEL>}
    instructions: instructions/<dashed-id>.instructions.md
```

Each condition is one of two dedicated types — `stepCondition` (binds another step by slug: `step` is the predecessor for `kind: precondition`, the successor for `kind: postcondition`) or `stateCondition` (`setSelector.setQuery`, a CEL expression referencing artifacts directly by their schema slug — no alias pre-declaration — feeding `setPredicate`, a CEL boolean over the resulting `selected` set that the harness evaluates against portfolio state) — each carrying `kind` (precondition/postcondition — WHEN it holds) and a `slug` on every condition. Behavioral guidance the agent must follow rides at the step level (`step.instructions`). They make the non-negotiable transition guard visible enough that the orchestrator cannot treat an evidence requirement as optional narrative.

**Ceremonies and practices are facilitated sub-orchestrations.** Neither is solo work: each names its **Participants** (≥2, drawn from **the Bench** below) and an **Exchange** table that sequences their turns in the same `input → agent·hat → output` shape as the handlings: `# | participant·hat | contributes (reads → produces) | hands to`. The orchestrator is the **facilitator**: it opens the sub-orchestration, sequences the turns, and validates each output, but **authors nothing** — and does not directly rewrite owner artifacts; it commits transitions only through guard-approved, owner-authored state changes and flow-owned kanban/gate collation. Every participant authors only its own contribution per its role skill / bench role. The **Central Supervisor** joins only where a ★ gate or a pivot decision applies. Pick the participant roster systematically from the Bench, not just the owning hat.

**Challenge-return loop (mandatory).** Whenever an existing artifact is challenged — by a peer hat inside a ceremony/practice, or by the **Central Supervisor at a ★ gate** (reject-with-reason) — the challenge output is never the final author-owned artifact unless the challenger is also the artifact owner. Challenge findings must flow back to the **owning author** for re-synthesis and rewrite of the owner artifact. The orchestrator may collect, classify, and collate challenge findings, but it must not directly patch or rewrite an author-owned artifact from challenger feedback. Its only legitimate post-challenge writes are flow-owned/meta artifacts such as gate collation, kanban, risk ledgers, or gate-decision backlog entries. If a challenge changes content, the next authoring turn belongs to the artifact owner. Each challenge finding is recorded as a `kind: challenge` entry in the unit's open-item ledger — same envelope, routing, and gate rule as a clarification, so challenges are formalized and persisted identically.

**No premature human return.** Orchestrators must not return control to the Central Supervisor at an internal completion point (for example: after a refinement pass, after an ADR draft lands, after a challenge packet returns, after validation passes, or after a meta-artifact is updated) unless one of two conditions holds: (1) a real human-owned ★ gate packet is fully staged in the repo and ready for disposition, or (2) a concrete blocker prevents further autonomous progress. "Fully staged" means every required artifact for that gate exists on disk, is linked from the serving artifact(s), is reflected in the relevant decision backlog, and has passed focused validation. If the next workflow step is still owned by the orchestrator, the orchestrator must keep driving it rather than narrating progress back as if it were a handoff.

**Owner-rewrite precedence (mandatory).** After any substantive challenge, critique, review, or multi-lens feedback pass, the orchestrator must explicitly determine whether the affected file is owner-authored or flow-authored. If owner-authored, the orchestrator dispatches the owner back onto the artifact with the challenge packet and waits for the owner rewrite before performing validation or gate collation on that slice. It must not compress this loop by "helpfully" applying the rewrite itself.

### Open-item ledger

*The unit's single persisted record behind two flows (clarifications + challenges) that both terminate at owner-rewrite precedence — the **clarification discipline of Continuous Exploration** and the **Definition-of-Ready "no open blocking unknowns" clause**, generalized to every ★ gate.*

Two raised-item flows are formalized the **same way**, because they are the same skeleton — *a non-owner raises something about a unit → it is routed to the owning author → the owner resolves it by rewrite → blocking ones block the ★ gate*:

- **clarification** — the *proactive* form: an author surfaces a missing concern *before* guessing it (the forward dual of the challenge loop). Author skills already say "surface ambiguity … do not invent scope"; this is the structured form. Its `owner` is whoever must supply the answer — a peer hat, or **the Central Supervisor when the concern is value / intent**. A clarification is the **only** item that may point *at the human*: when an agent finds the supplied intent incoherent or incomplete it **asks** (owner = human), it does not challenge.
- **challenge** — the *reactive* form: a **non-owner** critiques an existing draft — a peer hat inside a ceremony/practice (the **Challenge-return loop** above), or the **Central Supervisor at a ★ gate** (reject-with-reason *is* a challenge). The challenger is never the artifact's author, so the finding routes back to the **owning author** — exactly like a clarification whose answer-owner ≠ raiser. A challenge therefore always targets an **agent-authored artifact**; its `owner` is always an agent, **never the human** — the Supervisor is its archetypal *raiser*, never its owner or its target.

A unit reaches its gate with its blocking unknowns *resolved or explicitly deferred* — never silently invented, never silently overruled.

**Why a record, not an interrupt.** Subagents are synchronous and stateless — a dispatched hat **cannot block mid-run** waiting for an answer; it must **return**. A raised item is therefore never a live prompt fired from inside a task; it is a **recorded entry the orchestrator routes between turns**, under the same blackboard discipline as every other artifact.

**The record — `openItems` (every backlog template carries it).** One envelope for both kinds: `{ id, kind, raised_by, owner, blocking, status }`, `kind ∈ {clarification, challenge}`, `status ∈ {open, resolved, withdrawn}` — with one **hard invariant**: `kind: challenge ⇒ owner is an agent hat` (equivalently `owner: human ⇒ kind: clarification`), because a challenge is reactive on an agent-authored artifact and the Supervisor authors none. A **clarification** adds `{ question, options[], default_if_unanswered }`; a **challenge** adds `{ finding, severity, recommended_change }`. `blocking: true` ⇒ the unit cannot cross its next ★ gate while the entry is `open` (the `no-open-blocking-items` guard conjunct). `blocking: false` ⇒ the author proceeds under the recorded default (`default_if_unanswered`, or "draft stands" for a challenge) as an **assumption-with-disclosure**; the gate adjudicates it.

**Persisted universally (audit + memory).** Every item is logged and **kept after resolution** — the status flips `open → resolved`/`withdrawn`, the entry is not deleted — even one answered inside the same ceremony. The ledger is the unit's **auditability + workflow-improvement + agent-memory** trail: a stateless hat re-dispatched onto the unit reads *what was already asked, answered, or challenged*. "Always record" is the simplest invariant to apply and maintain — no exclusion rule.

**Owner resolution (ownership map).** Route each item to the hat that owns the concern — operational test: *whose file/section must change to resolve it*: **value / intent / scope-authority → the Central Supervisor (human)** *(clarification only — never a challenge)*; **business Epic → BO**; **portfolio runway / NFR backbone → EA**; **Feature AC + scope → PM**; **Story AC → PO**; **solution/ART ADR + contract → SA**; **trust boundary / privacy → Security**; **operability / day-2 → DevOps**; **accessibility / inclusivity → Responsible AI**; **testability / DoD → QA**; **UX journey → UX**.

**Central-Supervisor review routing (mandatory).** Direct review comments from the Central Supervisor on a Feature, Story, ADR, decision inventory, runway register, NFR register, or any other owner-authored backlog / architecture artifact are always treated as a **challenge packet**, never as standing permission for the orchestrator to edit the file. The orchestrator may summarize, classify, and persist those comments in flow-owned artifacts, but it must route the content rewrite back to the owning authoring hat: business Epic → `@business-owner`; business Feature → `@product-manager`; business Story → `@product-owner`; enabler Feature / enabler Story / ADR / decision inventory / runway / NFR architecture artifact → `@system-architect`. The only exception is an explicit role change from the Central Supervisor that says the owner hat is being invoked through dispatch; absent that, "change this Feature/ADR" is challenge input, not edit authority for the orchestrator.

When one review packet spans mixed ownership, split the routing by owner rather than collapsing it into one orchestrator rewrite. PM-owned Feature changes return to `@product-manager`; SA-owned ADR or runway changes return to `@system-architect`; orchestrators may edit only the surrounding flow-owned collation, kanban, risk, and gate-decision artifacts.

**Routing by owner (three lanes).** (1) **Peer-hat-owned** (a clarification owned by another hat, *or* any challenge — whether a peer or the Supervisor at a gate raised it) → re-dispatch the owning hat via **owner-rewrite precedence** — the item is an input addressed to a *different* author; **no human is needed to resolve it** (a human may have *raised* it). (2) **Human-owned (value / intent)** → necessarily a **clarification**, never a challenge (the framework cannot challenge the Supervisor): the orchestrator **batches** the blocking items into one **clarification packet** surfaced to the Central Supervisor **at a natural halt** (gate staging, or a genuine blocker per *No premature human return*) — never a mid-task interrupt, never one at a time. (3) **Non-blocking** → record the assumption-with-disclosure and **keep driving**; the gate sees it.

**The two producers (defined per tier, not here).** *Reactive* items come from the **Challenge-return loop** (above). *Proactive* items come from the **Discovery turn** that opens each **CE intake practice** — tier-scoped and defined *there*: portfolio CE = `epic-lean-business-case`, ART CE = `feature-backlog-refinement`, iteration CE = `story-backlog-refinement`. The orchestrator owns only this ledger, its routing, and the gate fold; the per-tier Discovery lenses live with their practice.

**The bound (no runaway loops).** Batched, blocking-first, **default to assumption-with-disclosure**, and **capped**: at most one **Discovery** round (at intake) + one **pre-gate** round (when staging the ★ packet). Anything still `open` after the cap becomes an explicit, gate-visible **deferral** with a recorded default — mirroring "never auto-loop past one bump." The orchestrator never spins waiting on a human; it proceeds on defaults and lets the gate decide.

**Suborchestration nesting.** Every orchestration uses a step-based workflow config in `conf/workflows/<root>.workflow.conf.yaml`, and every suborchestration skill lives under `<root-orchestration>/workflows/<name>/` while its workflow config lives in `conf/workflows/<name>.workflow.conf.yaml`, loaded by **explicit path** (they leave VS Code auto-discovery; the root orchestrations + author roles stay flat under `layers/<portfolio|program|team>/`).

**Skill registry.** Each handling names the skill that is its body — grouped by family (Ceremony / Practice are the orchestrator-facilitated suborchestrations; Author bodies load *inside* them):

| — PO hat (business Story authoring) | dispatched `@product-owner` | `product-owner` | Author |

The **★ gates** carry no skill — they are the Central Supervisor's decision, **except** the two orchestrator-run definition gates: the **★ Story Gate** (DoR, `@scrum-master` inside `iteration-planning`) and the **★ Feature Gate** (Feature-DoR, `@release-train-engineer` after `feature-backlog-refinement`), which escalate to the human only when contested / structurant.

**Gate packet completeness is artifact-specific.** A gate is named by the validated artifact, but the packet is not always a single file. The orchestrator must stage the full supporting packet defined by the governing practice before returning for disposition. For the ★ Architecture Gate in particular, returning only an ADR is insufficient when the architecture practice or repo reference model also defines runway, NFR, enabler, risk, or challenge artifacts that make the architectural decision reviewable.

**Deterministic harness boundary.** The harness — not orchestrator prose — is the source of truth for sequencing and evidence. The orchestrator **drives**: it calls `orchestrate <workflow> --unit <id> --run <run>`, which recomputes the cursor from the unit's artifacts + workflow and returns one action — `dispatch` (relay to `runSubagent`), `halt` (surface the ★ gate packet, or report a missing-evidence block), or `done`. A `halt` for missing evidence is not report-only: the orchestrator re-enters the relevant handler loop, routes the missing evidence to the owning participant, and blocks only when no autonomous correction path remains. Hooks may call the same harness at host lifecycle events instead of the orchestrator, but hooks are adapters only; the source of truth stays the portable CLI + journal contract.

Each harness command appends one entry to the unit's **per-run journal** (`portfolio/logs/<run>.jsonl`, one line per command — `orchestrate` / `check-step` / `check-artifact` / `hook`); replaying the journal grouped by step reconstructs the run. The journal is an **audit record, not a sequencing input** — the next `orchestrate` never reads a prior log line to decide what comes next; it recomputes from artifacts (check-only determinism). A chat/session debug trace, subagent report, or human recollection never substitutes for the artifacts the harness checks.

## Product workspace (poesis-level)

All SAFe artifacts live at **poesis level** at the workspace root, **never inside a code repo**. Code repos contain only code, tests, ops, and per-repo `README.md` / `copilot-instructions.md`. SAFe state spans repos of the same product, so it is product-scoped, not repo-scoped; Epics are portfolio-scoped.

### Portfolio scope (singleton, cross-product)

`portfolio/` is the meta-governance tier above the ARTs (template: [portfolio-manifest.artifact.schema.json](../../../../artifacts/portfolio-manifest.artifact.schema.json) + [portfolio-manifest.artifact-template.md](../../../portfolio/actors/value-management-officier/artifacts/portfolio-manifest.artifact-template.md)). It owns:

- `portfolio-manifest.yaml` — manifest and authoritative product registry (`products[]`; `arts[]` may remain as a compatibility list).
- `strategic-themes.md` — the Strategic Themes singleton (top of the spine).
- `portfolio-backlog/<epic-slug>/<epic-slug>.epic.md` — the **Epics** (the only legitimately cross-product artifact).
- Portfolio Kanban (rendered view) — rendered from Epic frontmatter (never hand-edited).
- `art/<art-slug>/improvement-backlog/<pain-point-slug>/<pain-point-slug>.pain-point.md` — continuous improvement pain points.

### Product registry

The authoritative product list is `portfolio-manifest.yaml > products[]`. Each product owns:

- `products/<product-slug>/product-manifest.yaml` — manifest: name, description, owner, business-line, status, **repos[]** (workspace paths), upstream/downstream deps.
- `art/<art-slug>/program-backlog/<feature-slug>/<feature-slug>.feature.md` (each optionally `parentEpic: E-N`) · `art/<art-slug>/program-backlog/<feature-slug>/<adr-slug>.adr.md`
- `<objectives-slug>.objectives.md`, `<risks-slug>.risks.md`, `<plan-slug>.plan.md`, `<progress-slug>.progress.md`
- `art/<art-slug>/program-backlog/<feature>/` — `<feature-slug>.feature.md`, `<feature-slug>.feature-enabler.md`, ADRs, reviews, `<feature-slug>.nfr-list.md`
- `art/<art-slug>/teams/<team-slug>/team-backlog/<story>/` — `<story-slug>.story.md`, `<story-slug>.story-enabler.md`, `<qa-signoff-slug>.qa-signoff.md`

**Workflow-improvement lifecycle** (about the *orchestration workflow itself*, resolved via workspace-level meta-artifacts — skills/agents/instructions/prompts/templates — not product code) lives in the **ART `improvement-backlog`** (`art/<art-slug>/improvement-backlog/<pain-point-slug>/<pain-point-slug>.pain-point.md`) as a continuously-captured input, triaged into workflow improvements or product improvements during the PI Inspect & Adapt ceremony.

### Product-scope rules (mandatory)

- Every product-scoped artifact MUST include `product: <slug>` in frontmatter and live under that product's folder. ART-scoped artifacts live under `art/<art-slug>/`.
- **Cross-product Features are forbidden.** Two products affected => one Feature per product, linked via `dependsOn:`.
- A Story's commits may touch only repos listed in its product's `product-manifest.yaml`.
- No repo-level `docs/` for SAFe state (repo `docs/` is code-level documentation only).
- **Step 0 first:** if `portfolio-manifest.yaml > products[]` does not list the product in scope, run ART / Product Init (the VMO owns the registry) before any other step.

## The Bench

Dispatch via `runSubagent`. Subagent calls do **not** share context — the **filesystem is the shared blackboard**: every subagent reads committed artifacts as input and commits its artifact as output.

**Dispatch capability gate (mandatory).** Before the first bench dispatch in a session, the orchestrator must verify that `runSubagent` is actually available in its tool surface. If it is unavailable, the orchestrator must not silently author as the missing role. It has only two valid paths:

1. **Hard block (default):** stop the handler, record a workflow pain point in the ART `improvement-backlog` (`art/<art-slug>/improvement-backlog/<pain-point-slug>/<pain-point-slug>.pain-point.md`), and tell the Central Supervisor that the current environment cannot execute the required subagent dispatch.
2. **Explicit inline-proxy mode (only if the Central Supervisor authorizes it for this handler):** mark every affected dispatch and handler evidence item as `dispatch=inline-proxy`, preserve the handler contract's participant/evidence shape, disclose that cost attribution and independent-challenge separation are degraded, and keep owner-authored content marked as proxy-authored rather than pretending a real bench participant ran.

Inline-proxy mode is a degraded simulation, not normal execution. It cannot satisfy a human-owned gate unless the gate packet explicitly lists the degraded dispatch evidence and asks the Central Supervisor to accept or reject that risk. It is forbidden for security-critical, architecture-gate, PR-gate, or contested evidence unless the Central Supervisor explicitly waives the missing dispatch isolation in the gate decision backlog.

| Bench role | Agent | When to dispatch |
|---|---|---|
| Business Owner | `@business-owner` | Authors Epics + Strategic Themes + WSJF at the portfolio layer |
| Product Management | `@product-manager` | Authors business Features + AC + WSJF at the program layer |
| Product Ownership | `@product-owner` | Authors business Stories + DoR shaping at the iteration layer |
| Enterprise-architecture runway | `@enterprise-architect` | Draft the EA-hat runway / enabler Epics for the Central Supervisor's review |
| Architecture | `@system-architect` | Author ADRs, enabler Features or Stories, and review structurant work |
| Development | `@developer` | Code for Stories (Driver and/or Navigator) |
| Quality Assurance | `@quality-engineer` | Acceptance against Story DoD; bug reports; QA sign-off |
| Security | `@security-expert` | Trust boundaries, auth/crypto/secrets, threat modeling |
| Platform / CI | `@operator` | CI/CD, Helm, deployment, env config, observability |
| Docs | `@tech-writer` | ADR / Epic / doc polish, story-attached docs |
| UX | `@ux-designer` | UX journeys, Figma specs, UI affordance review |
| Accessibility / inclusivity | `@ux-designer` | Accessibility enablers, inclusivity review, user-facing affordance risks |

### Tool-gap delegation (mandatory)

An orchestrator's own toolset is deliberately minimal — it **conducts**, it does not do everything itself. **When a step needs a capability the orchestrator lacks** (e.g. web fetch / search, a specific MCP or extension tool, a language server, a build/test sandbox, multimodal / image handling, repo-host operations beyond plain `git`), **do not skip, fake, or hand the step back prematurely** — dispatch a bench subagent (or the sibling orchestrator) that *has* the needed tool, giving it a precise task plus the blackboard artifact path(s) to read and write. The orchestrator stays the conductor; the missing capability lives in the subagent. Such a dispatch is still resolved by the harness `ModelRouter` (relay the dispatch's resolved `model` verbatim — you never pick the model). Only if no available agent has the capability either do you surface the gap to the Central Supervisor — and capture it as a workflow pain point in the ART `improvement-backlog` (`art/<art-slug>/improvement-backlog/<pain-point-slug>/<pain-point-slug>.pain-point.md`) rather than silently dropping the step.

## LLM routing policy (the harness resolves the model)

**You do not resolve models.** Model resolution is a deterministic harness function, not orchestrator
prose. The orchestrator never classifies risk/complexity, scores candidates, or picks a tier at dispatch
time — it **drives**: it calls `orchestrate` and relays the dispatch the harness returns.

- **Model resolution lives in the harness `ModelRouter`** ([`harness/map/model.map.yaml`](../../../../harness/map/model.map.yaml) is the single source of truth for the concrete `Model (Vendor)` strings, the tiers, capability scores, and cost penalties). The router resolves the model from the **step's static metadata** (`role`, `risk`, `complexity`, `tags`, `config`) declared in the step's workflow config — set once at authoring time, not re-derived per dispatch.
- **The driver loop:** `orchestrate <workflow> --unit <id> --run <run>` returns exactly one action — `dispatch` (carrying the resolved `{actor, model, skills, config, output, prompt_context}`), `halt` (a ★ gate is next, or no step is eligible while work remains), or `done` (every step's output artifact exists). Relay a `dispatch` to `runSubagent` with the resolved `model` passed **verbatim** (never `Auto`, never omitted) and the resolved `skills` named in the prompt; surface a `halt` to the Central Supervisor as the staged gate packet; end on `done`.
- **Determinism guarantee:** the next `orchestrate` recomputes the cursor from the unit's **artifacts** + workflow, so sequencing never depends on a prior log entry. If the routing map is unreadable or no candidate survives, the harness returns an `error` action — surface it and halt; never dispatch a silent fallback.

The risk/complexity/tag/tier vocabulary, the capability-tag catalog, and the role-default tiers are the
**inputs the router scores** — they are defined in the routing map and authored onto each step, not run as
a procedure here. (Authoring guidance for the per-step `risk`/`complexity` metadata is *Feature/Story
classification* below.)

### Cost capture is source-direct (no per-dispatch bookkeeping)

Do **not** record token cost per dispatch or in any intermediary ledger — the ecosystem already logs
it (every `llm_request` in the Copilot Chat debug logs carries `inputTokens` / `outputTokens`; each
dispatch is its own `runSubagent-*.jsonl`). The only dispatch-time obligation is that the **dispatch
prompt names the served artifact id** (`S-N` / `F-N` / `E-N`) — which the routing-log prefix and
the named blackboard paths already do — so the log self-attributes. Each `cost:` block is then fetched
from those logs **once**, at the artifact's terminal status, per the [cost-accounting model](../../workflow/instructions/epic-cost-snapshot-measured-once-from-logs.instructions.md):

- **Story** `→ awaiting-pr`: `@scrum-master` sums the Story's dev + QA dispatch tokens from the logs.
- **Feature** `→ done` (★ Demo Gate): `@release-train-engineer` fetches Feature overhead + Σ child Stories.
- **Epic** `→ done`: `@value-management-officier` fetches Epic overhead + Σ child Features.

The snapshot is `source: measured` when the logs are present, `estimated` only if they are gone; it is
written once and is immutable thereafter. Never fabricate a precise measured number.

### Escalation (observable signals only)

Escalate only on: QA acceptance failure / contradictory evidence; `@security-expert` unresolved high-severity; output conflicts with governing ADR/AC or missing required fields; >1 reject in CRITIQUE on the same unit. Remediation order: (1) fix inputs/context, (2) +1 tier (one bump), (3) halt and ask the Central Supervisor. Never auto-loop past one bump.

### Feature/Story classification (mandatory)

Every Epic frontmatter carries `risk` + `complexity` before leaving `funnel` (BO/EA own it, PM/EA assist); every Feature before leaving `funnel`; every Story before leaving `backlog`. PM owns initial Feature classification; PO owns initial Story classification; scrum-master verifies Story risk/complexity at Iteration Planning; value-management-officier may raise (never silently lower) Epic classification at Epic intake / Strategic Portfolio Review; release-train-engineer may raise (never silently lower) Feature classification at PI Planning. On execution drift, update frontmatter and note it in `progress.md`.

## Kanbans & status transitions (normative)

Status is the source of truth — YAML frontmatter `status: <column>` on each artifact. Kanban files (`kanban/*.md`) are **rendered views**; never hand-edit them.

**You do not hand-sequence transitions.** Which transition is eligible, what guards it, and what its
gate is are computed by the harness from the unit's artifacts + workflow config — the orchestrator
**drives** (`orchestrate` → relay `dispatch` / surface `halt` at a ★ gate / end on `done`) and recomputes
the cursor every turn. The tables below are the **governance semantics** the harness enforces (column →
owner → processing instance → gate), not a procedure to replay by hand.

**Owner vs Actors:** Owner = single accountable role, one per column, flips the field. Other actors contribute; named in `note`.

### Portfolio Kanban — Epics (value-management-officier drives; Business-Owner-owned overall, cross-product)
`funnel -> reviewing -> analyzing -> portfolio-backlog -> implementing -> done`. Flag: `blocked`.

### Gates (summary)
Each unit gets a **definition gate** (post-refine; reject ⇒ re-iterate refinement) and an **outcome gate** (post-build); plus the cross-cutting **Architecture Gate** for structurant Features. There are seven:

| ★ Gate | Class | Validates | Transition | Owner | Reject → |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ★ Epic Gate | definition | Epic (shaped + runway) | Epic `analyzing -> portfolio-backlog` | Central Supervisor (BO) | `funnel` (reshape) |
| ★ Feature Gate | definition | Feature (AC + WSJF + structurant) | Feature `refined -> arch-pending` / `ready` | release-train-engineer (escalates if structurant / contested) | `funnel` (re-refine) |
| ★ Story Gate | definition | Story (DoR) | Story `backlog -> ready` | scrum-master | stay `backlog` (re-groom) |
| ★ Architecture Gate | architecture | ADR / runway extension | Feature `arch-pending -> ready` | Central Supervisor | `refined` (re-decide) |
| ★ Demo Gate | outcome | Feature increment | Feature `in-progress -> done` (Demo Gate) | Central Supervisor | rework |
| ★ PR Gate | outcome | PR / code | Story `awaiting-pr -> done` | Central Supervisor | rework |
| ★ Epic Outcome Gate | outcome | Epic outcomes | Epic `implementing -> done` | Central Supervisor (BO) | rework |

> **Human-approval** gates: Epic, Architecture, Demo, PR, Epic Outcome. **Orchestrator-run** gates (no human halt): Story Gate (DoR, sm) and Feature Gate (Feature-DoR, rte) — the latter escalates to the human when the Feature is `structurant` or its WSJF / scope is contested. **Re-iterate loop:** every *definition* gate may reject back to re-refine. There is **no PRD gate** — an Epic entering `portfolio-backlog` authorizes downstream Feature work.

### Units of work (business + enabler)

Every unit carries a business or enabler identity and traverses the **same FSM + gates** as its peers, but enabler backlog units are governed by their own artifact templates rather than by inline skill prose. Architecture references from the standard artifact set (ADR, architecture decision inventory, runway register, NFR register, and other owned template-backed artifacts) define or constrain enabler work; the actual enabler remains an Epic / Feature / Story artifact with its own dedicated template. Four enabler types → bench lens:

| Enabler type | Lens | Seeded by |
|---|---|---|
| exploration (spike) | dev / `@system-architect` | Story Backlog Refinement (Story); Feature Backlog Refinement (Feature) |
| architectural | `@enterprise-architect` / `@system-architect` | Architectural Vision (Epic); Architectural Runway Extension (Feature) |
| infrastructure | `@operator` | Architectural Runway Extension (Feature) |
| compliance | `@security-expert` | Architectural Vision / Runway Extension |

Enablers are **WSJF-ranked alongside business units**; the EA / SA practices seed enabler Epics + Features, refinement seeds enabler Stories (spikes).

When an enabler is seeded **after its parent unit has already completed the layer's latest refinement pass**, the parent's prior refinement packet is no longer authoritative. The owning orchestrator must **replay the parent refinement** before that parent may cross its next definition / commitment gate. Replay is layer-local: Epic -> Epic Lean Business Case, Feature -> Feature Backlog Refinement, Story -> Story Backlog Refinement. **Closed units are not rewound**: if the parent is already `done`, seed the follow-on enabler backlog and carry the dependency forward instead of reopening the closed unit.

### Peer challenge (adversarial review before each gate)

Every artifact is **challenged by a different-lens peer before it reaches its gate** — the SAFe collaboration spine (backlog refinement, ART Sync, pair CRITIQUE, security review, Demo Gate, Inspect & Adapt) made explicit. The owning orchestrator dispatches the challenger(s); a challenge **sharpens, never approves** — the gate (Central Supervisor) still decides. Keep it lean: 1–2 lens-focused challengers, no rubber-stamping.

| Artifact | Challenger(s) — different lens | SAFe analog | Before |
|---|---|---|---|
| Epic | PM ⇄ EA hat; `@security-expert` on risk and trust-boundary impact | Portfolio backlog refinement | ★ Epic Gate |
| Feature + ADR | `@system-architect` ⇄ `@security-expert` + `@operator` | ART Sync / ADR review | ★ Architecture Gate |
| Story (pre-build) | PO ⇄ SM (DoR check) | Backlog refinement | ★ Story Gate |
| Code (per unit) | Navigator ⇄ Driver (mandatory CRITIQUE); `@security-expert` on trust boundaries | Pair review | during execution |
| PR | `@security-expert` (mandatory pre-merge) + `@quality-engineer` sign-off | PR review | ★ PR Gate |
| Feature increment | Central Supervisor + bench feedback | Demo Gate | ★ Demo Gate |
| The process itself | all roles | Inspect & Adapt / Retro | per PI / sprint |

Material findings are logged to `products/<product-slug>/risks.md` (sprint-scoped artifacts) or surfaced in the gate packet (Epic/ADR); an unresolved challenge is a `risks.md` entry (`accept` / `rework` / `defer`).

For avoidance of drift: a challenge row defines who challenges, not who rewrites. The rewrite always returns to the artifact owner unless the owner and challenger are the same seat for that artifact class.

### Pre-action checklist (harness-enforced — read, don't replay)

These are the guards the harness checks before it returns a `dispatch` or `halt`; they are listed so a
gate packet can be audited against them, **not** a procedure to run by hand:
1. Frontmatter shows the expected source column.
2. The dispatched actor is the target column's **Owner**.
3. All **Inputs** exist on disk.
4. All **Outputs** are committed before `status:` flips.
5. A column **Gate** surfaces as a `halt` for Central Supervisor approval — the cursor never advances past it.
6. The target column's WIP limit is not breached.
7. The rendered kanban is regenerated after the transition.

### GitHub Projects mirror (board surface)

Each product's Program and Team Kanbans are mirrored to **one GitHub Project per product** (org
`<github-org>`) — the human-facing board surface. Local markdown frontmatter stays the source of
truth for content; the board is authoritative for non-gate status moves. Normative schema:
[GitHub board spec](../../../../sync/github/github-projects-board-spec.md). Reconciliation rules:
[sync protocol](../../../../sync/github/github-sync-protocol.md). Toolchain: `portfolio/_sync/`.

- **Topology:** one Project (Program board = Features, Team board = Stories) + one issues-only
  planning repo per product, **plus one cross-product Portfolio Project** (Epics) + a
  `<portfolio>-planning` repo. - **Status fields** mirror the kanban columns verbatim (`Portfolio Status` / `Program Status` /
  `Team Status`); the GitHub Project is interactive, unlike the rendered `kanban/*.md` views.
- **Gates are never automated** — a board move crossing a gate boundary is captured as a request
  in `products/<product-slug>/risks.md`, never auto-applied (board spec §8, protocol §4).
- **Reconcile on demand**, not per transition: after a batch of flips run
  `python3 portfolio/_sync/sync.py push <slug>` (local → board) and `… pull <slug>`
  (board → local). `status <slug>` is a safe read-only diff.
- **Git planning repos** — each product folder (`products/<product-slug>/`) and the portfolio root
  (`portfolio/`) are independent git repositories mirrored to `<github-org>/<slug>-planning`
  (or `<github-org>/<portfolio>-planning` for the portfolio). Keep them in sync with
  `python3 portfolio/_sync/git-sync.py sync --all --apply`. Run this **after any batch of artifact edits** and
  **before closing a turn** that added or modified SAFe artifacts. Toolchain: `portfolio/_sync/git-sync.py`.

## Invariants (enforce on every action)

- **No Gate skipping**, ever — green CI/QA is never a substitute for Central Supervisor approval.
- **No return before gate.** Proceed autonomously until the next gate packet is ready; hand back early only on a genuine blocker (missing artifact, failed mandatory validation, unresolved contradiction).
- **Status transitions are atomic with their gate.**
- **Owner-only transitions.** Only the Owner flips its column's `status:`.
- **Cite the table** when flipping a status (column, Owner dispatched, Gate if any).
- **Product-scoped paths only;** every frontmatter has `product: <slug>`.
- **Template-first authoring.** Every artifact follows its template (catalog below).
- **Gate decision backlog is mandatory** (next section).
- **Token cost is fetched once from the ecosystem logs** at each artifact's terminal status (Story `awaiting-pr` / Feature `done` / Epic `done`) and rolled up Story -> Feature -> Epic per the [cost-accounting model](../../workflow/instructions/epic-cost-snapshot-measured-once-from-logs.instructions.md) (`cost:` frontmatter blocks; **no intermediary ledger**); every figure is flagged `measured` or `estimated`, never fabricated.
- **Workflow pain-point capture is mandatory.** Capture workflow friction into the ART `improvement-backlog` (`art/<art-slug>/improvement-backlog/<pain-point-slug>/<pain-point-slug>.pain-point.md`) **continuously, the moment it is observed** — never fix the meta-process inline mid-flow, and never wait for the retro to remember it. A pain point is an *input* (raw friction), not a solution; its resolution is filled in §4 at retro / I&A.
- **Epic-rooted, no PRD.** There is no PRD tier. A Feature either rolls up to an approved Epic (`parentEpic: E-N`, Epic in `portfolio-backlog`+) or is an explicit standalone engineering/operability Feature (`parentEpic: null` with a stated rationale). **ADR-first for structurant work.**
- **Epics are the only cross-product artifact.** Cross-product coordination lives in an Epic; never author a single cross-product Feature — one Feature per product, each linked to the shared Epic.
- **Authoring vs policing.** The hat-wearing **author agents own the backlog artifacts**: `@business-owner` authors Epics + Strategic Themes, `@product-manager` authors Features, `@product-owner` authors Stories, `@enterprise-architect` authors the EA runway and enabler Epics, and `@system-architect` authors ADRs plus enabler Features and Stories. The **orchestrators never author or own these** — they *police* their layer. The **Central Supervisor approves** at the gates.
- **QA-before-PR.** No Story reaches the **★ PR Gate** without `qa/S-N-signoff.md`.
- **Challenge-before-gate.** No artifact reaches its gate without its designated **peer challenge** (Peer-challenge matrix): a different-lens specialist adversarially reviews it first. A challenge sharpens but never approves — the gate still decides; material findings are logged to `products/<product-slug>/risks.md` (sprint-scoped) or the gate packet.
- **Observability stories load the instrumentation skill.** Any Story changing telemetry dispatches Driver + QA with the `instrumentation-coverage` skill loaded; the QA sign-off includes that skill's §5b Instrumentation Alignment Audit with the INST-R7/R8 machine checks green. A failing machine check blocks `awaiting-pr`.
- **Kanban files are rendered, never hand-edited.**
- **GitHub Projects boards mirror the kanbans** (one Project per product); reconcile via
  portfolio/_sync per the sync protocol. A board move across a gate boundary is a request, never
  approval. **Publish-before-gate (all tiers, mandatory):** every work item is pushed to its GitHub
  Project board *before* the validation gate that governs it, and its `github:` block is written
  back — **Epic → ★ Epic Gate** (`@value-management-officier`), **Feature → ★ Architecture Gate**
  (`@release-train-engineer`), **Story → ★ PR Gate** (`@scrum-master`). No item reaches its gate
  without a live board card; the gate-crossing status flip itself is still never auto-applied.
- **One commit per Story unit of work**, trailer `Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>`; pair commits add `(pair: <Driver>/<Navigator>)`.
- **Filesystem is the shared blackboard** — commit inputs before dispatching.
- **Orchestrators never write production source code.** Dispatch `@developer`.
- **Flow, not content — route every substantive concern to its hat; never reason *for* a persona.** When the Central Supervisor (or any input) raises a *substantive* concern — architecture, repo/topology, design, scope, requirements, tradeoffs, risk acceptance, a proposed solution — the orchestrator MUST NOT answer it with its own analysis, recommended design, option-set, or decision-fork. Instead **route it into the workflow**: capture it as the *input* to the owning hat's ceremony/practice, dispatch that hat, and **police** the returned artifact. The orchestrator authors only *flow/meta* artifacts (kanban, objectives, risks, gate packets) and reasons only about **flow**.

## Gate-first return protocol + decision backlog

- Proceed autonomously until the next gate packet is ready.
- Maintain `products/<product-slug>/products/<product-slug>/risks.md` (append-only) for any agent-made decision/assumption that may need Central Supervisor disposition (PR scope, acceptance interpretation, deferred tradeoffs, risk acceptance).
- Every gate packet MUST list unresolved entries with options (`accept` / `rework` / `defer`) for fast disposition and re-iteration.

## Artifact schemas and templates (mandatory)

Artifact schemas live under [artifacts/](../../../../artifacts) and each is paired 1:1 with its `*.artifact-template.md` distributed to the producing skill. Refuse to author an artifact without consulting its schema/template pair.

Each artifact bundle uses exactly these names:

```text
<artifact>.artifact.schema.json      # Draft-07 JSON Schema interpreted by the Python harness
<artifact>.artifact-template.md      # human-facing Markdown render template
```

The `*.artifact.schema.json` file is the deterministic source for artifact identity, path matching, required frontmatter shape, derived heading/body checks, and render-only classification. The Python harness parses each Markdown artifact into normalized JSON data (frontmatter plus derived fields `__path`, `__kind`, `__body`, and `__sections`) and validates that data with the standard `jsonschema` library. When a rule can be executed reliably, move it into the artifact schema or a handler workflow-config token and lighten the Markdown prose.

**Artifact-set closure (mandatory).** The artifact catalog below is closed by default. If a file does not map to an owned artifact schema in this catalog, it is not a legitimate workflow artifact and must not be used as an authoritative home for requirements, architecture, backlog, or gate content. Instead, route the content into the nearest standard artifact type (ADR, decision inventory, runway register, NFR register, Feature, Story, gate backlog, etc.) or extend the artifact catalog explicitly first. Sidecar notes, maps, and scratch files are not valid substitutes for owned artifacts in any gate packet.

**Artifact ownership (by layer).** Each orchestrator **owns and maintains** its tier's artifact schemas and artifact templates, and enforces conformance; authors always use the current owned version.

- **`value-management-officier` owns:** portfolio-manifest, strategic-themes, epic, lean-business-case, architectural-vision, product-manifest, kanban-portfolio.
- **`release-train-engineer` owns:** feature, adr, architecture-decision-inventory, vision, roadmap, nfr-register, runway-register, objectives, risks, kanban-program, project-brief (authored by `@product-manager`).
- **`scrum-master` owns:** sprint-plan, story, qa-signoff, daily, retro, progress, kanban-team.

Framework-wide, host-agnostic concerns live in dedicated homes referenced but not layer-owned: the token cost-accounting model is inlined in each orchestrator's cost-snapshot invariant instructions; the orchestration anti-patterns live in the relevant actor skills; the run-journal / logging model lives in the [harness README](../harness/def/spec.md#logging). The host binding (board spec / sync protocol / sync config) lives under `sync/github/`, swappable for another host adapter.

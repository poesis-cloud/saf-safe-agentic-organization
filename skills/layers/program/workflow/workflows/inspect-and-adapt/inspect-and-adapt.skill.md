description: '**SAFe CEREMONY SKILL.** The Inspect & Adapt playbook loaded by `@release-train-engineer` at PI end. USE FOR: the PI quantitative metrics review + the problem-solving workshop; root-causing program-scope pain points from the ART improvement-backlog; dispatching owning actors to create derived Features/Stories/enablers. DO NOT USE FOR: the ★ Demo Gate (use `system-demo`); portfolio re-ranking (use `strategic-portfolio-review`); iteration retrospectives. Loaded by `@release-train-engineer` before facilitating.'

# SAFe Ceremony — Inspect & Adapt

The **program-scope** closed-loop event at the end of a PI. It has **no system demo** (that is the separate `system-demo` workflow). The **normative spec** is the machine-readable **[config/workflows/inspect-and-adapt.yaml](../../../../../../config/workflows/inspect-and-adapt.yaml)** — every step + its `conditions` (metrics review → retrospective), consumed by `@release-train-engineer` and the harness (`check-step` / `check-artifact`). Load and follow it; do not restate it here.

Shared model (the open-item ledger, ★ gates, the bench, invariants, artifact templates) lives in **[RTE orchestration core](../../../actors/release-train-engineer/release-train-engineer.skill.md)**.

## Step instructions

- **Step 1 — Metrics review**: [instructions/metrics-review.instructions.md](instructions/metrics-review.instructions.md)
- **Step 2 — Retrospective**: [instructions/retrospective.instructions.md](instructions/retrospective.instructions.md)

**Only `@release-train-engineer` facilitates I&A and updates pain-point `status`. Derived Features, Stories, and enablers are authored by their owning actors.**

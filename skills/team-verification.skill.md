description: '**SAFe PRACTICE SKILL.** The Verification & Sign-off practice (Continuous Integration / Built-In Quality) loaded by `@scrum-master` per Story (when a Story is `in-qa`). USE FOR: `@quality-engineer` verifying the Story against its Definition of Done + `@security-expert` rendering the trust-boundary verdict, producing the `qa-signoff`. DO NOT USE FOR: the ★ PR Gate (Central Supervisor); coding (use `pair-programming`); the iteration demo (use `iteration-review`). Loaded by `@scrum-master` before facilitating; returns the sign-off — the sm commits `in-qa→awaiting-pr` (or `→in-progress` on fail).'

# SAFe Practice — Verification & Sign-off (Built-In Quality)

A **practice** (Continuous Integration) that produces the QA sign-off. The **normative spec** is the machine-readable **[config/workflows/verification.yaml](../../../../../../config/workflows/verification.yaml)** — every step + its `conditions` (the trigger as the first step's preconditions; the DoD acceptance + Security verdict + INST audit + sign-off obligations as conditions; the structural `after`/`input`/`output` wiring), consumed by `@scrum-master` and the harness (`check-step` / `check-artifact`). Load and follow it; do not restate it here.

Shared model (the open-item ledger, ★ gates, the bench, invariants, artifact templates) lives in **[scrum-master orchestration core](../../../actors/scrum-master/scrum-master.skill.md)**. The sign-off uses the **qa-signoff** template; no Story reaches `awaiting-pr` without it (observability Stories include the instrumentation-coverage audit, INST-R7/R8 green); **only `@scrum-master` writes `status:`** (`in-qa→awaiting-pr` on pass / `in-qa→in-progress` on fail).

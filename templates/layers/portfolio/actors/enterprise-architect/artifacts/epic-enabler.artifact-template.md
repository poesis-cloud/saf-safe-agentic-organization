# Enabler Epic Template — `portfolio-backlog/<epic-slug>/<epic-slug>.epic.md`

Portfolio-scoped backlog contract for **enabler Epics**. Use this template when `type: enabler`.
An enabler Epic is a first-class portfolio backlog unit, not an architecture note: it exists to
fund and govern runway work that enables downstream product Features and program execution.

# E-1 — <title>

## Enablement statement
### Syntax
Use exactly one hypothesis block in this canonical form:
> To enable <products / ARTs / capabilities> to <deliver or operate something>, the <Epic name>
> provides <architectural runway / infrastructure / compliance foundation>. We will know we are
> ready when <dependent Features / ART capabilities> can proceed with reduced risk or removed
> constraints, evidenced by <leading indicators>.

## Runway outcome & leading indicators
### Syntax
- `Leading indicator: <early measurable signal>`
- `Lagging indicator: <later outcome signal>`
- Add more bullets only when each is materially distinct.

- Leading indicator: ...
- Lagging indicator: ...

## In scope / out of scope
- In: ...
- Out (non-goals): ...

## Enablement rationale
Why this runway investment matters now, and what delivery or operability risk it removes.

## Enabler properties
- Consuming products / Features: ...
- Unblocked capabilities / constraints removed: ...
- Validation evidence expected before closure: ...

### Syntax
- `Consuming products / Features: <product slug and/or work-item ids>`
- `Unblocked capabilities / constraints removed: <single sentence>`
- `Validation evidence expected before closure: <test, report, review, or artifact>`

## Enterprise-Architect runway (EA hat)
Cross-product architectural implications, NFR backbone, shared enablers, and which
products must build runway.

## Affected products & Feature seeds
### Syntax
Use one row per product seed in this form:

| Product | Feature seed (becomes F-N in that product) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| <slug> | <one-line enabler Feature intent> | ... |

## MVP & pivot/persevere
The smallest enabler Feature set (`mvpFeatures`) that makes the blocked delivery path viable.

### Syntax
- `MVP feature set: <Feature id list or named seed list>`
- `Ready when: <evidence that the blocker is removed>`
- `Rework when: <evidence that the runway is still insufficient>`

## Dependencies / constraints
Other Epics, external systems, regulations.

## Work-item relations

Use only relation types that materially shape sequencing or runway intent.

- `dependsOn` — hard prerequisite relation. Use when this enabler Epic cannot remove its target
  constraint before another Epic produces a prerequisite decision or capability.
- `enables` — primary relation for enabler Epics. Use to name the downstream Epics or Features whose
  path becomes viable because this enabler lands.
- `relatedTo` — non-gating adjacency. Use for shared runway area or conceptual coupling that should
  remain visible but must not drive scheduling.
- `supersedes` — replacement relation. Use when this enabler Epic intentionally retires or absorbs an
  earlier runway Epic.

Best-practice rules:

- Prefer `enables` over vague prose when the value of the enabler is specifically to unblock named
  downstream work.
- Use `dependsOn` sparingly; enablers should remove blockers, not accumulate them without cause.
- Do not encode architecture references (ADR ids, runway files, NFR registers) as work-item links;
  keep this contract limited to backlog units.

## Open items
The human-readable companion to the `openItems:` frontmatter ledger (the [open-item
ledger](../../value-management-officer/value-management-officer.skill.md#open-item-ledger)) — this enabler Epic's **clarifications**
(proactive unknowns surfaced by the CE Discovery turn) and **challenges** (reactive findings from
peer review), formalized identically and routed to the owning hat. Every **blocking** item must be
resolved before the ★ Epic Gate; non-blocking items are resolved or explicitly deferred with a
recorded default. The ledger is kept after resolution as an audit + agent-memory trail.

### Syntax
One bullet per item, mirroring a frontmatter entry:
- `I<n> [clarification|challenge] [blocking|non-blocking] (raised_by: <hat>, owner: <EA|Security|DevOps|human>): <question or finding>` — default if unanswered: `<assumption>`; status: `open|resolved|withdrawn`.

- I1 [clarification] [non-blocking] (raised_by: <hat>, owner: ...): ... — default if unanswered: ...; status: open
```

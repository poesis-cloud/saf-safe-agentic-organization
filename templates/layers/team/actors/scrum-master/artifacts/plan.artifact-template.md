# Sprint N — [Name]

> Sprint Goal: [one sentence describing the deliverable]
> PI: M | Branch: feature/sprint-N
> Estimated effort: [time estimate]

## Prioritized Story List

| # | Story | Feature | ADRs | Driver | Navigator | Est | Description |
|---|-------|---------|------|--------|-----------|-----|-------------|
| S-1 | [story] | F-N | [adr ids] | default-dev | default-dev | 1h | [what to build] |
| S-2 | [story] | F-N | [adr ids] | default-dev | @security-expert | 2h | [trust-boundary work] |
| S-3 | [story] | F-N | [adr ids] | @ux-designer | default-dev | 1h | [UX-driven work] |

Pair convention: first-named = initial Driver, second-named = initial Navigator.
Roles swap each pair-programming micro-cycle (see the scrum-master skill § Pair Programming).

## Work Schedule

### Phase 1: [Name] (S-1 .. S-3)
- Dispatch pairs sequentially
- Checkpoint commit after phase

### Phase 2: [Name] (S-4 .. S-6)
- Dispatch pairs sequentially
- Checkpoint commit after phase

### Phase 3: Acceptance & Polish
- RTE runs acceptance against every Story DoD (QA duty)
- File blockers as GitHub Issues
- Open PR for the ★ PR Gate only when no blockers remain

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Every Story meets its DoD
- [ ] Every commit carries pair attribution + Copilot trailer
- [ ] All dependent ADRs are `accepted`
- [ ] CI green
- [ ] Per-Story QA sign-off files exist in `art/<art-slug>/teams/<team-slug>/team-backlog/<story-slug>/<qa-signoff-slug>.qa-signoff.md`

## What's NOT in This Sprint

| Story / Feature | Reason |
|-----------------|--------|
| [deferred item] | [why — scope, ADR pending, dependency] |

## RTE Dispatch Prompt

> @release-train-engineer — Read PROJECT_BRIEF.md and products/<product-slug>/<plan-slug>.plan.md. Execute Sprint N.
>
> First: git pull origin main && git checkout -b feature/sprint-N
>
> For each Story, dispatch the named Driver/Navigator pair as subagents.
> Pairs run the pair-programming micro-cycle and commit on feature/sprint-N.
> Close GitHub Issues in commits: "fix: description (Fixes #NN)".
> Update the Progress section of this same plan.md after each Story.
> When all Stories pass acceptance, push and open a PR.
> Wait for the ★ PR Gate (human approval) before merging.
> Follow Sections 12-14 of PROJECT_BRIEF.md.

## QA Sign-off Roll-up

Per-Story QA sign-off is captured in `art/<art-slug>/teams/<team-slug>/team-backlog/<story-slug>/<qa-signoff-slug>.qa-signoff.md`. The sprint-level roll-up is appended here, in this same plan.md:

### Stories Accepted

| Story | DoD met? | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| S-1 | ✅ | |
| S-2 | ✅ | |
| S-3 | ❌ | blocker #NN open |

### Test Results
- Tests run: X
- Tests passed: X
- Tests failed: 0

### Blockers
NONE   (or: list of GitHub Issues with severity:blocker)

### Issues Filed
- #NN — [description] (severity: minor)

### Result
✅ PASS — No blockers. Sprint N ready to open PR for the ★ PR Gate.
   (or: ❌ HOLD — blockers must clear before the ★ PR Gate)
```

## Lifecycle

Created at Iteration Planning; updated by SM at every Daily Sync (Progress section) and at Iteration Review (Done + QA Sign-off Roll-up sections). One file per iteration — there is no separate progress artifact/file.

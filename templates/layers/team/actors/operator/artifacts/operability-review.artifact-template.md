# Operability Review Template — `products/<product-slug>/.../reviews/<subject>-operability-review.md`

Authored by `@operator`. The operability verdict on a subject (a Feature, runway item, deployment topology, or release) — CI/CD, Helm, environment config, observability, and runtime concerns. One review per subject per attempt; a `fail` records blocking `openItems`.

## Verdict
**PASS** — operationally ready.
*(or)* **CONCERNS** — non-blocking issues recorded as `openItems`.
*(or)* **FAIL** — blocking operability defect; subject returns to its owner.

Remediation guidance, owner, and target.

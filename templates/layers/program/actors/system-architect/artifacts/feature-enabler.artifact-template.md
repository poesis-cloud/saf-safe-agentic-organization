# Enabler Feature Template — `art/<art-slug>/program-backlog/<feature-slug>/<feature-slug>.feature.md`

Product-scoped backlog contract for **enabler Features**. Use this template when `type: enabler`.
An enabler Feature is a first-class program backlog unit that realizes runway work needed by named
business Features, higher-order enablers, or operational constraints.

# F-12 — <title>

## Enabler intent
Describe the runway capability, engineering support, or risk reduction this Feature delivers.

### Syntax
Use a short paragraph or 2-3 bullets in this form:
- Capability: <runway or engineering capability delivered>
- Constraint removed: <blocked condition or risk reduced>
- Consumer: <named downstream Feature, Story, or delivery path>

## Acceptance criteria
### Syntax
- Use one flat bullet per criterion, labeled `AC1`, `AC2`, `AC3`, ...
- Use only one of these forms:
  - `- AC1. Given <technical context>, when <action or condition>, then <observable result>.`
  - `- AC2. <Platform/system/control> must <measurable technical, operational, or compliance result>.`
- Each criterion must state what capability is now usable or what downstream work is unblocked.

- AC1. ...
- AC2. ...

## Enablement hypothesis
Explain what future delivery, operability, compliance, or architectural decision this Feature
makes possible, safer, or cheaper.

### Syntax
Use 2-3 bullets in this form:
- Downstream change: <what can happen now>
- Risk/cost effect: <what becomes safer, cheaper, or faster>
- Evidence: <how the improvement will be observed>

## Enabler properties
- Consuming Features / enablers: ...
- Unblocked capabilities / constraints removed: ...
- Validation evidence expected before closure: ...

### Syntax
- `Consuming Features / enablers: <id list or named capability>`
- `Unblocked capabilities / constraints removed: <single sentence>`
- `Validation evidence expected before closure: <test, report, review, or artifact>`

## NFR applicability / trace
List the canonical product NFRs from `<feature-slug>.nfr-list.md` that apply to this Feature, plus any
Feature-specific tightening or derived verification notes.

## Routing classification
- Risk: low | medium | critical.
- Complexity: simple | involved | complex.
- Rationale: why these values are correct for this Feature.

## Dependencies
Other Features, ADRs, external systems.

## Work-item relations

Use typed relations to make the enabler's program effect explicit.

- `dependsOn` — hard prerequisite relation. Use when this enabler itself relies on another Epic or
  Feature outcome before it can remove the intended blocker.
- `enables` — primary enabler relation. Use to name the downstream Features or Stories whose path is
  opened by this work.
- `relatedTo` — non-gating adjacency. Use when two units share the same runway area but do not
  impose ordering on one another.
- `supersedes` — replacement relation. Use when this enabler absorbs or retires an earlier Feature.

Best-practice rules:

- At least one `enables` target is expected whenever the enabler exists to unblock named downstream
  work; if absent, explain the broad platform/operability outcome in prose.
- Do not mirror architecture artifacts here; keep `adrs` for decisions and `workItemRelations` for
  backlog-unit links only.

## Architecture decision inventory
If `structurant: true`, point to the committed architecture inventory artifact
that tracks the Feature's decision units, their coverage state, linked ADRs,
waivers, and enabler follow-up. If `structurant: false`, set
`architectureInventory: null` and omit this section.

## Open items
The human-readable companion to the `openItems:` frontmatter ledger (the [open-item
ledger](../../release-train-engineer/release-train-engineer.skill.md#open-item-ledger)) — this enabler Feature's **clarifications**
(proactive unknowns surfaced by the CE Discovery turn) and **challenges** (reactive findings from
peer review), formalized identically and routed to the owning hat. Every **blocking** item must be
resolved before the ★ Feature Gate (or the ★ Architecture Gate when `structurant: true`); non-blocking
items are resolved or explicitly deferred with a recorded default. The ledger is kept after
resolution as an audit + agent-memory trail.

### Syntax
One bullet per item, mirroring a frontmatter entry:
- `I<n> [clarification|challenge] [blocking|non-blocking] (raised_by: <hat>, owner: <SA|Security|DevOps|human>): <question or finding>` — default if unanswered: `<assumption>`; status: `open|resolved|withdrawn`.

- I1 [clarification] [non-blocking] (raised_by: <hat>, owner: ...): ... — default if unanswered: ...; status: open
